# The Plan
## Why do we need this?
There appears to be a need for a non-profit organization that exists solely to promote the adoption and support of the Ruby language itself. Ruby Central shares this purpose but is primarily occupied with organizing RubyConf and RailsConf, though they have offered software grants and assistance to various projects as well. The Ruby Together organization also exists to promote Ruby, though their lack of 501(c)(3) status allows board members to accept payment from the organization itself, and this along with some transparency questions has led to a lack of trust from the community. The Ruby Software Foundation would provide grants and scholarships for Ruby developers, potentially including direct payments to open source developers, but the board members would not be eligible to receive these payments and the methods and means of those processes would be entirely transparent. This does not necessarily mean that board members would not be paid; it's important for diversity of membership and overall participation that members be compensated somehow when possible. There are a lot of restrictions on how board members of a 501(c)(3) can be compensated however, so this piece will require some thought. Board members should not be eligible for grants, scholarships or contract work, in order to build trust in the community that their funds are being used responsibly.
## Mission
I believe that a mission statement should guide every decision made by this type of organization, so it follows that we should come up with that first.

These are some example mission statements from similar software foundations:

### Apache Software Foundation
The mission of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is to provide software for the public good. We do this by providing services and support for many like-minded software project communities of individuals who choose to join the ASF.

### Python Software Foundation
The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.

### Linux Foundation
Founded in 2000, The Linux Foundation provides unparalleled support for open source communities through financial and intellectual resources, infrastructure, services, events, and training. Working together, The Linux Foundation and its projects form the most ambitious and successful investment in the creation of shared technology.

### Node.js Foundation
The Node.js Foundation’s mission is to enable widespread adoption and help accelerate development of Node.js and other related modules. We do this through an open governance model that encourages participation and technical contribution, and by providing a framework for long term stewardship by an ecosystem invested in Node.js’ success.

### OpenStack Foundation
The goal of the OpenStack Foundation is to serve developers, users, and the entire open infrastructure ecosystem by providing a set of shared resources to build community, facilitate collaboration and support integration of open source technologies.

Selecting the most used words from these examples and combining them in order I have assembled the following mission statement as our starting point:

*"The and of to foundation is software support by open mission."*

It may need some work.

## Goals
- Act as a vehicle for corporations and individuals to donate money they know will be used to promote the Ruby language and the open source ecosystem around it.
- Provide educational resources to bring a diverse group of new developers to Ruby and assist those already in the community as they gain proficiency.
- Allow corporations an easy avenue to provide feedback on the direction of the community and the language, in a way that doesn't bind anyone to implement their suggestions.
- Fund organizations that do Ruby outreach and education directly to assist them in their efforts.
- Offer members a clear and accessible method of understanding where their contributions add value and why their help is important.

## Logistics

Meetings should be recorded and available online, along with notes. Communication amongst board members should happen on a public mailing list or Slack channel. When a need for private discussion arises, around a code of conduct issue for example, the need for privacy will be explained clearly in the notes and the relevant portions of the video will be removed. Because these meetings will be public they will need to be relatively formal in their structure. There should be some form of parliamentary procedure, preferably much lighter weight than the default Robert's Rules of Order, with at least some focus on consensus-based decision-making when possible.

Officers will be elected by the board, board members will be elected by the membership. In the beginning it will be necessary to seed the board as there will not be any members to elect them, and some seats should be guaranteed, at least Matz and DHH.

The number of board members is up for discussion, but it should always be kept above 5 and would probably be most effective with fewer than 10 members. If a board member is unable to attend a meeting they should be permitted to send a proxy to vote on their behalf. Proxies may only vote on existing proposals and present proposals authored by their board member, they may not act in an official capacity on behalf of officers nor can they introduce their own proposals.

Potential list of candidates for the initial board:

*(this is not a complete list, please add potential candidates liberally while we're brainstorming)*

- Matz
- DHH
- Sarah Mei
- Evan Phoenix
- Chad Fowler
- Aaron Patterson
- Linda Liukas
- Coraline Ada Ehmke
- Terence Lee
- Nobu
- Justin Searls
- Aman Gupta
- Eric Hodel
- Sandi Metz
- Katrina Owen
- Charles Nutter
- Koichi
- Sora
- Akira Matsuda
- Kerri Miller
- Sam Phippen
- Eileen Uchitelle

Open voting is risky given the potential for a troll takeover; we'll need to develop safeguards and potentially allow the sitting chair to veto any candidate under certain circumstances.

There should be 2 quorums, one to modify the rules and structure of the organization (80%+) and another to accomplish daily business (60%+).
Proposals should be submitted before the meeting to allow time for agenda creation. We will need some cap on discussion, probably 10 or 15 minutes, after which proposals that don't reach consensus (or potentially majority if consensus fails) will be automatically tabled.

## Corporate Memberships

Corporate memberships can be incredibly lucrative but they need to be handled carefully. Money should never be allowed to buy direct influence over the organization or Ruby itself. Corporate members in the top tier sponsorship level should be entitled to attend meetings and introduce proposals, but they should NOT be voting members of the board. Voting for board members and access to a simple method of petitioning them to introduce proposals should be available to all members of the organization even at the free tier. Paid membership in the organization should convey other benefits; stickers, badges, anything else we can come up with. There is a huge risk in building something like this that it becomes pay-to-play and we should do everything we can to avoid it.

That being said, getting a company to pay $100k/yr for membership in the RSF will require some special incentive beyond marketing and bragging rights. The opportunity to have the ear of those making decisions is a large incentive.

## Influencing Ruby

The goals of the organization don't include guiding the development of the Ruby language itself, but it may be useful to have some formal process for passing suggestions along to the core team, or allowing the Ruby maintainers simple access to the membership so they can assess interest in potential features or direction.
Obviously none of these suggestions would be binding in any way, but there is probably value in having some process to make them anyway. The real objective is to offer value to the Ruby maintainers, but the alternative means of bubbling up important feature/bug tickets in the tracker may also be attractive to potential corporate members. They obviously could file it themselves, but we offer a simplified process and support in clarifying their proposals.
